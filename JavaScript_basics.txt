# Javascript basics
====================

variable declaration:
---------------------
var test = "string";

semi colon at the end of line is optional.

7 basic data_types:
-------------------
string, number, boolean, BigInt, null, undefined and

if, else if, switch:
--------------------
syntax is similar to c++

for, while loop:
----------------
syntax similar to c++

Arrays:
-------
declaration and usage is similar to c++j
var num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

Functions:
----------
syntax:
function func_name(params)
{
....
}
JS functions don't return any values.

Object literals and the dot notation:
-------------------------------------
One of the most common ways of building an object in JavaScript is using the object literal syntax: {}.

It essentially consists of two steps: 

1. Declaring a new variable and assigning an object literal to it - in other words, this: var assistantManager = {} 
2. Assigning the values to each of the object's keys, using the assignment operator, =

Notice that it's very easy to build any kind of an object in JavaScript using this example syntax.

For example, here's a table object:
var table = {
    legs: 3,
    color: "brown",
    priceUSD: 100,
}

To access the table object, I can simply console log the entire object:  
console.log(table);//display the object in the developer console

The returned value is the entire table object:  
{legs: 3, color: 'brown', priceUSD: 100}

Additionally, I can console log any individual property, like this:  
console.log(table.color); // 'brown'
